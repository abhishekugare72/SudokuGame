Project Title: Sudoku Solver
    
Project Description:
Sudoku Solver is a web-based application built using React, GSAP, and Lucide React. The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to solve Sudoku puzzles.
  
Key Features:
Sudoku Puzzle Solver: The application can solve Sudoku puzzles with a single click.
Puzzle Validation: The application validates user-inputted puzzles to ensure they are correct.
Reset Functionality: The application allows users to reset the puzzle to its original state.
  
Technical Details:
Frontend: The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Animations: GSAP is used to create smooth and engaging animations throughout the application.
Icons: Lucide React is used to provide a set of beautiful and consistent icons.

Validation Logic:
The validation logic is used to check if the user-inputted puzzle is correct. Here are the steps involved in the validation logic:
Check for empty cells: The algorithm checks if there are any empty cells in the puzzle. If there are, it returns an error message.
Check for duplicate values: The algorithm checks if there are any duplicate values in each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid. If there are, it returns an error message.
Check for invalid values: The algorithm checks if all the values in the puzzle are between 1 and 9. If there are any values outside this range, it returns an error message.
Check for consistency: The algorithm checks if the puzzle is consistent with the standard Sudoku rules. If it's not, it returns an error message.
  
Solving Algorithms:
The solving algorithm is used to solve the Sudoku puzzle. Here are the steps involved in the solving algorithm:
Find an empty cell: The algorithm finds an empty cell in the puzzle.
Try a value: The algorithm tries a value between 1 and 9 in the empty cell.
Check if the value is valid: The algorithm checks if the value is valid by using the validation logic. If it's not, it tries another value.
Recursively try values: The algorithm recursively tries values in the empty cell until it finds a valid one.
Backtrack: If the algorithm can't find a valid value, it backtracks to the previous empty cell and tries another value.
 
Project Structure:
The project is structured into the following components:
App.js: The main application component that renders the Sudoku puzzle and handles user input.
Puzzle.js: A component that represents a single Sudoku puzzle and handles puzzle logic.
Solver.js: A component that solves the Sudoku puzzle using a built-in algorithm.
Validation.js: A component that validates user-inputted puzzles.
  
Conclusion:
Sudoku Solver is a web-based application that provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to solve Sudoku puzzles. Built using React, GSAP, and Lucide React, the application demonstrates expertise in building modern web-based applications.
